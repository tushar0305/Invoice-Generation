/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Saambh Jewellers Invoice App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for customers,
 * and allows owner-only access to invoices and invoice items.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /customers/{customerId}: Stores customer profiles. Only the customer can read/write their own profile.
 * - /invoices/{invoiceId}: Stores invoice data. Only the customer associated with the invoice (via customerId) can read/write the invoice.
 * - /invoices/{invoiceId}/invoiceItems/{invoiceItemId}: Stores individual invoice items. Access is restricted to the owner of the parent invoice.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own customers and associated invoices/invoice items.
 * - Listing of customers and invoices is allowed only for the respective owner.
 * - Data shape is not validated in this prototype to allow for rapid iteration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Invoice` entity includes a `customerId` field. This is intentionally denormalized to avoid needing to perform a `get()` operation to the `customers` collection to validate ownership when accessing invoices.
