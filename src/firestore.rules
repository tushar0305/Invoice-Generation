/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Saambh Jewellers Invoice App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can only manage
 * their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /customers/{customerId}: Stores customer profiles. (Not currently used, but rules are in place).
 * - /invoices/{invoiceId}: Stores invoice data. Only the user associated with the invoice (via userId) can read/write it.
 * - /invoices/{invoiceId}/invoiceItems/{invoiceItemId}: Stores invoice items. Access is inherited from the parent invoice.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can ONLY manage their own invoices and associated data.
 * - Listing invoices is ONLY allowed when querying for one's own invoices.
 * - Data shape validation is omitted in this prototype for rapid iteration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Invoice` entity includes a `userId` field. This is intentionally denormalized to avoid needing a `get()` operation to another collection to validate ownership when accessing invoices, which is more performant and a best practice for security rules.
